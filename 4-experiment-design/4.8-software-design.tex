\subsection{Software Design}

\subsubsection{Purpose}

The purpose of the On-Board Software consists of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Controlling the tracking and choosing of targets to observe.
	\item Ensuring that the camera is not oriented towards the sun.
	\item Reading data from sensors and controlling actuators when needed. 
	\item Processing and storing images taken by camera.
	\item Logging housekeeping data.
	\item When possible, send images and housekeeping data to ground station.
\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Design}

\paragraph{a)} Process Overview\\

\begin{figure}[H]

	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{4-experiment-design/img/software/process-overview.png}
	\caption{Relations between On-Board Computer and connected components.}
	\label{fig:software-process-overview}
\end{figure}

All external components connected to the On-Board Computer and their interface are displayed in figure \ref{fig:software-process-overview}.

\paragraph{b)} General and safety related concepts\\

To ensure that the software is not erroneous rigorous testing will be done during development and after completion. A watchdog timer will be used to avoid software freezing. This timer will reset the On-Board Computer if it is not itself reset by the software within a certain period. In the case of a reset, the camera shall move to the launch position and tracking restarted.

\paragraph{c)} Interfaces\\

If connection to ground is available, images compressed with a lossless compression will be sent down over the E-link over the course of the experiment. If the storage were to fail on touchdown for any reason, this would mean that not all data is lost.


\input{4-experiment-design/tables/software-interfaces.tex}


\paragraph{d)} Data acquisition and storage\\

The main bulk of data handled is the images taken by the camera. Housekeeping data such as positioning, camera direction, time, etc will also be stored along with the images.

As the camera has a resolution of $5496 * 3672$ and a colour depth of 12 bits, the raw image size will be 30.27 MB. For a 4 hour float phase and an exposure time of 30 s a total of  14.53 GB is required in on-board data storage for the images. 

With a maximum of 1 Mbit per second data transfer rate to ground it takes at least 145.5 s to transfer one image compressed losslessly to 60\% of original size. This means that with little down time between observations and for most exposure times, not all images can be transmitted to ground.

\paragraph{e)} Process Flow\\

Pre-launch tests shall be conducted to ensure that all systems work as expected. Afterwards the system shall enter a sleep mode with the camera in a safe launch position. When the float phase is reached, the system will wake. After wake-up the system shall find its orientation and the position of the sun. Finally tracking and observation can start.

Astronomical targets are prioritised. The software shall track and observe the highest priority target within the field of view with varying camera settings until one of the following events happen:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Current target leaves operational field of view.
	\item Target moves too close to the sun for observation.
	\item A higher priority target enters the field of view.
\end{itemize}

If one of the aforementioned events happen, the software will switch current target following prioritisation. While observing targets, the On-Board Software shall store images and housekeeping data. If connection to ground is available this data shall be compressed using a lossless compression method and sent to ground.

At the end of the floating phase the camera shall be oriented in a landing position and the system shall shut down. Figure \ref{fig:software-activity-diagram} shows the complete process flow. Figure \ref{fig:software-state-diagram} shows a simple state diagram for the experiment. Observations are done in the Normal state. In the rare case of a software freeze, it will be reset without entering sleep mode.

\paragraph{f)} Modularisation and pseudo code\\

		\end{itemize}
		
	\item Thermal: Module responsible for active thermal control
	
	\item Watchdog: Timer to reset external watchdog.

		\end{itemize}

	\item Init: Module initialising each component.
		
	\item Mode: Module responsible for the current state of the software.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Implementation}

The code for the On-Board Software shall be implemented in C. An operating system will be used to enable the modularisation required. Additional libraries may be needed.
