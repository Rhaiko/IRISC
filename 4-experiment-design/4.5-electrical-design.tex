\subsubsection{Block Diagram}
\label{sec:4.5.1}
The architecture of the electrical design is shown in figure \ref{fig:electronic-architecture}.

See Appendix c.

\subsubsection{PCB Layout}
There will be three PCB:s, which are listed below: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	Power system & Motor control 
	\item	Gyroscopes 
	\item 	Sensors
\end{itemize}

The two PCB:s, Power system & Motor control  and Gyroscopes, will be located in the main electrical box. They will be placed on top of each other. %, see figure \ref{fig:electronic-box}

%\end{figure}


While the third PCB will be placed in its own second electrical box. Because this PCB includes the sensors as GPS, accelerometers and magnetometer. Thus the PCB should not be too close to the other PCB:s or the DC motors due to disturbances, such as for example magnetic field changes. The schematics of all the PCB:s can be found in appendix C.
