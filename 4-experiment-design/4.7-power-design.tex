\label{sec:4.7}

A 28.8V (13 Ah) battery package can be provided by the gondola, according to the BEXUS user manual. Thus the gondola would provide 374.6 Wh. But due to the harsh environment in the gondola one should expect a capacity no larger than 6 Ah and a cell voltage around 3 V(yielding a battery voltage of 24V), which means that the gondola would provide 144 Wh. One constraint is that the batteries has a 5A fuse, and a continuous maximum current is 1.8 A is recommended.\hl{Thus the power supply unit will need to step down the voltage, while stepping up the current. This was done with TRACO power components and voltage regulators.. The voltages needed are: 3V3, 5V and 12V.}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \hl{ THN 30-2411W1 : 28.8 V --> 5 V, with the power 30 W.}
	\item \hl{THN 30-2412Wi : 28.8 V --> 12 V, with power 30 W.}
	\item \hl{NCP1117ST33T3G - LDO: 28.8 V --> 3V3, 3.3 W}
\end{itemize}


The estimated power consumption of the components are shown in table \ref{tab: power consumption}.

The BEXUS manual recommends the instrument be prepared to have power supplies for 2 hours of testing, 2 hours on ground and for a flight time of 6 hours as a minimum. \hl{Since IRISC required a lot of power IRISC will be dependent on ground power  until T-40. The estimated time that the experiment would need power from the gondola is 2 hours of ascent and 3 hours of flight. Thus the estimated power consumption was:  }

\begin{itemize}
    \item \hl{Active mode : 126.44 Wh (4h) }
    \item \hl{Standby mode: 53.55 Wh(6h)}
\end{itemize}

Thus the experiment exceeded 144Wh. Thus the experiment needed two battery packages. With two battery packages the gondola would be able to provide at least 288 Wh, which was estimated to satisfy the power needs of the experiment.
