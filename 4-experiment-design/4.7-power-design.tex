\subsection{Power System}

\label{sec:4.7}

A 28.8V battery package can be provided by the gondola, according to the BEXUS user manual. One constrain is that the continuous maximum current is 1.8 A. Thus buck-converters will be needed to step down the voltage, while stepping up the current, so that the power needed will be delivered to the instrument. The voltage levels of the buck converters are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Active mode: 38.02 W  --> 304 Wh (8h)
    \item Sleep mode: 15 W --> 45Wh (3h) 
\end{itemize}

Thus the instrument will require at least 349 Wh. The maximum power provided by the gondola will be 375 Wh, which should satisfy the instruments needs.
