\subsection{Power System}
A 28.8V battery package can be provided by the gondola, according to the BEXUS user manual. One constrain is that the continuous maximum current is 1.8 A. Thus buck-converters will be needed to step down the voltage, while stepping up the current, so that the power needed will be delivered to the instrument. The voltage levels of the buck converters are: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item 28.8 V --> 3.3 V, with the power 1.65 W.
	\item 28.8 V --> 5 V, with power 15 W.
	\item 28.8 V --> 12 V, with power 15 W.
\end{itemize}

A schematic of the power system can be found in the appendix C.

The estimated power consumption of the components are shown in table \ref{table: power consumption}. The experiment should be able to run for at least for 10 hours.

From the gondola there will be 374 Wh ? avalible, but IRISC needs 380.185 Wh to be able to run for 10 hours. Thus extra batteries will be needed.
