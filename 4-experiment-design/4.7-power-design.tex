<<<<<<< HEAD
A 28.8V battery package can be provided by the gondola, according to the BEXUS user manual. One constrain is that the continuous maximum current is 1.8 A. Thus buck-converters will be needed to step down the voltage, while stepping up the current, so that the power needed will be delivered to the instrument. 

The voltage levels of the buck converters are:

A 28.8V/1mA battery package can be provided by the gondola, according to the BEXUS user manual. Which should satisfy IRISC's power needs. One constraint is that the continuous maximum current is 1.8 A. Thus a buck-converter will be needed to step down the voltage, so that the power system will be able to provide the right voltages for the rest of the subsystems.
