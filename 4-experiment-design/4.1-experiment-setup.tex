%very general experiment setup
The experiment mounted a telescope with an attached CMOS sensor inside the gondola, looking out as shown in figure \ref{fig::4-1_CAD}. The telescope was mounted on a gimbal system that provided stabilisation along two axes and tracking in three dimensions. The sensor/telescope/gimbal system was shielded from the Sun's radiation and climatized in order to provide the required operation temperatures. This was achieved by using Peltier elements where heating or cooling may be necessary (e.\,g.~the sensor) and heating pads where there is only a chance of freezing (e.\,g.~the moving parts of the gimbal). The general setup with data flows can be seen in figure \ref{fig::4-1_block_diagram}. The individual sections of the experiment are described below.

\subsubsection{Telescope and CMOS sensor}
% telescope and CMOS sensor
The telescope chosen was a Sky-Watcher~BKP~130~DS (see figure \ref{fig::4.1-telescope}), a parabolic Newtonian reflector with a focal length of 650\,mm, an optical diameter of 130\,mm and therefore featuring an aperture ratio of $f/5$. 

The imaging sensor used is ZWO ASI183MM (mono) (see figure \ref{fig::4.1-sensor}), a CMOS sensor with only one channel (mono, not color) with a resolution of 20.18\,MP (5496x3672), a sensor size of 13.2x8.8\,mm (diagonal: 15.86\,mm) and a pixel size of 2.4x2.4\,$\mu$m. To limit the wavelength bandwidth imaged, an IR filter that filters out any wavelengths below 720\,nm was used in order to use the sensor as a NIR camera.

The imaging spectrum of the NIR imaging sensor is illustrated in figure \ref{fig::4.1-NIR_spectrum}.

This combination of telescope and sensor features the following specifications:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Field of View (FoV):} the field of view determines the astronomical targets that can be observed. It depends on the sensor size and the focal length of the telescope. Naturally, there is a horizontal, a vertical and a diagonal field of view:
	\begin{align}
		\text{FoV}_\text{horizontal} &= \arctan \frac{\SI{13.2}{mm}}{\SI{650}{mm}} = \ang{1,16} \\
		\text{FoV}_\text{vertical} &= \arctan \frac{\SI{8.8}{mm}}{\SI{650}{mm}} = \ang{0,757} \\
		\text{FoV}_\text{diagonal} &= \arctan \frac{\SI{15,86}{mm}}{\SI{650}{mm}} = \ang{1,382}
	\end{align}
	\item \textbf{Sensor resolution:} the angular resolution per pixel defines the precision of the scientific data collected.
	\begin{align}
		\text{Resolution} = \arctan \frac{\SI{2,4}{\um}}{\SI{650}{mm}} %= \SI{2,1155e-4}{\degree}
		 = \ang{;;0,7616}
	\end{align}
\end{itemize}

In order to examine the field of view in case the images sent down via downlink do not show the expected astronomical targets, an additional imaging sensor (ZWO ASI 290MM Mini) was installed on a guiding telescope that has a shorter focal length than the main telescope, implying a larger field of view (see figure \ref{fig::4.1-guiding_camera}). This sensor has the same sensitivity spectrum as the NIR camera, but it is not intended to block out any of the visible or NIR wavelengths in order to maximise the incident light and therefore the input signal. The spectrum is illustrated in figure \ref{fig::4.1-CMOS_spectrum}. With the help of these pictures it should have been able to correct offset errors in the pointing mechanism of the control system due to e.\,g.~temperature drift of the sensors. The images of the guiding camera are the ones used for the star tracker mechanism (described in section \mbox{\ref{sec::4-1_attitude_determination}}).

% content of electronics box
The On-Board Computer was hosted by the electronics box that also featured the onboard storage as well as the power supply unit, a GPS (for the control system), temperature sensors for housekeeping data and the heat management system inside the electronics box and heating elements. The sensors were located on a PCB designed by the electronics team, along with the power supply unit.
The gyroscope, a Sensonor STIM300 (shown in figure \mbox{\ref{fig::4-1_stim300}}) frequently used in aerospace applications such as rockets, was mounted directly on the telescope to measure the movements of the imaging unit with maximum precision without needing any additional mechanical or electrical interfaces.

% data storage, electronics box
The CMOS sensor data was transmitted to the On-Board Computer where it was compressed with lossless compression and stored onboard the BEXUS balloon. The onboard storage was located in the electronics box that is designed considering compatibility with the harsh environmental conditions. The mechanical structure that features the onboard storage ensured survival in case of shock due to hard impact when landing or if the BEXUS balloon lands in a lake or wetlands.

\subsubsection{Control system}
% control system and actuation
The control system was responsible for tracking the target in the sky and stabilising the telescope during exposure. The tracking used the current orientation of the telescope along the azimuth and elevation axes that was calculated by the star tracker as well as the orientation of the telescope within the gondola using encoders. Based on the current time and position (measured by the GPS system) as well as the operational field of view, the control system should have selected and tracked the target in order to point the telescope towards the astronomical targets and avoid star trails due to the sky's rotation as seen from an observer on Earth. The stabilisation system was responsible for keeping the telescope steady during exposure by counteracting the gondola movements measured by the gyrometer located directly on the telescope mounting structure.


\subsubsection{Attitude determination}
\label{sec::4-1_attitude_determination}
In order to determine the attitude of the gondola as it was rotating, the guiding camera also functioned as a star tracker. As the relative orientation of the telescope with respect to the gondola was known, the gondola attitude could be calculated and used for the control system. The star tracker was inspired by the system used by team GranaSAT which flew on Bexus 19. Their experiment was able to correctly identify 445 star fields and incorrectly identified 10. Several images had to be discarded due to a lack of found stars, but as their camera also acted as a horizon detector the FOV of stars was limited. As their software worked well and was run on-board on a Raspberry Pi the conditions were generally similar. Contact was established with members from team GranaSAT, and they offered to aid and answer questions about the star tracker. It should be noted that GranaSAT flew during night time, while IRISC flew during day time. However, as the tracker was to be used above the atmosphere it was expected to be able to producer similar results anyway.

Another system that had been shown to work under similar conditions is the Daystar Star Tracker \cite{daystar}. It was flown during daytime on a NASA balloon, piggybacking on a test of the WASP system. It was shown that daytime star tracking is possible with good results. Some of the modifications that had to be applied was a high pass filter to remove any Rayleigh scattering, and efficient star identification algorithms. Also, some extra image processing was needed. As their project was well documented, and all their software is open source, this too was used to aid the development of the star tracker for IRISC.

During the weeks before the launch campaign, several major discoveries and changes were made. When the previously chosen Tetra program was ready to be run it did so for many days before it was found that the expected size of the new hash table would be in the order of several terabytes. As this was not within the storage budget or reasonable for a project such as IRISC an emergency solution was needed. Instead of Tetra, a solution that had been looked at much earlier was implemented, called Astrometry.net. Minor changes were made to the program, as it included much functionality that was not needed. Some of these were stripped away, and some were changed to provide output in the format that the IRISC OBSW expected.
