\subsection{Ground Support Equipment}\label{sec:4.9}
A computer on the ground will be connected to the experiment via the E-Link. The ground support software will include a simple GUI which will enable an operator to issue commands to the experiment such as reset, target selection, and moving to landing position. Low resolution pictures will be received by the ground support software, which can be examined to verify nominal operation. The ground support software shall be written in C or MATLAB.
