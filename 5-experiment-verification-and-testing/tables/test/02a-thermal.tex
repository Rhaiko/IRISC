& The electronics, optics and camera should be placed in a freezer to test the components functionality with a simulated environment based on the one we expect to encounter. The temperature should be at -40\,$^\circ$C (or at least colder than -20\,$^\circ$C if not possible) The components may be tested separately, but should function during the test.
