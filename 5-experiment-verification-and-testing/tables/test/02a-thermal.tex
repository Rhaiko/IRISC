& The electronics, optics and camera should be placed in \st{a vacuum and} freezer to test the components functionality with a simulated environment based on the one we expect to encounter. The \st{pressure should be <5\,mbar and} temperature -80\,$^\circ$C (or at least colder than -40\,$^\circ$C if not possible) The components may be tested separately, but should function during the test.
\\ & Test duration: 15 minutes per test on the specified pressure and temperature. \\ \hline
