& Put the entire system in the replicated gondola and montage the system as would be montaged on the BEXUS flight. Let the system in sleep mode for atleast 2 hours (waiting) plus 1.5  hours (ascending) and simulate that the floating phase is reached. Then let the system work for at least 2.5 hours. Move the system around during the floating phase. Then simulate that the descending phase has started. Monitor the power and data usage during this test.
