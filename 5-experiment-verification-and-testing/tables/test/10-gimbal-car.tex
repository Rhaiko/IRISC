	& Fasten the system inside a car and drive around a bumpy road for a few minutes to obtain data on the behavior of the system when presented with a wide range of vibrations in every axis. Sensor data will be logged and reviewed after the test, as well as the position of the nuts and bolts in order to ensure that they will not become loose due to vibrations. After this test tunning will be performed where necessary.
