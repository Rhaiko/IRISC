& The sensors should first be read out one by one, without the other sensors connected. If multiple sensors or actuators are located on the same PCB, there should also be a test PCB available with each sensor and actuator separated from the prototype phase. Afterwards, the same is done for each actuator. Then, one by one, each sensor and actuator is added to the system to test the system as a whole.
