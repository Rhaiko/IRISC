& This test should be done after the functionality of the electronics is verified. Then all sensors and actuators should be tested integrated with the software. Let the gimbal be targeting 4 specific points with a separation of 90 degrees. Test if the gimbal stabilize the system when moved and switches targets based on the field of view. The targets should also be able to be switched on the ground station. Then add a 5th target which it may never look directly at and repeat the test.
\\ & Test duration: 5 hours. \\ \hline
