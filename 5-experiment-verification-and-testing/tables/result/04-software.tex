\textbf{Verification description} 	& Program four targets of interest and move the gimbal around. Determine if the targets are being followed. Then add a 5th point that the gimbal should never point, or around with the specified angle, and determine that this never happens. Connect the ground station and check if the system can be controlled remotely. \\ \hline

\textbf{Expected results} 			& The gimbal is able to chose targets and keeps it tracked and a specific target will never be looked directly at or nearby. \\ \hline

\textbf{Obtained results} 			& NOT PERFORMED \\ \hline

\textbf{Conclusions} 				& Not verified.		\\ \hline
