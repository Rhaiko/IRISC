\subsection{Results}

No results have been produced yet. More information will be provided following the launch campaign in a later version of the SED.

\subsubsection{Expected Results}

It is expected that since atmospheric interference is a large contributor to the reduction of target light intensity and increased noise in the final images, flight images will display increased clarity and finer detail, as well as an increased SNR as compared to images taken on the ground.
