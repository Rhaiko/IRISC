    	\textbf{Risk} & \textbf{Key Characteristics} & \textbf{Mitigation} \\\hline

    	Moving telescope lens &
    	A telescope is stabilized in three axes. Therefore there is the risk that the motor will start turning uncontrollably. &
    	Adding additional components so that at least a double component failure should occur before there is any risk. \\\hline

    	Sharp edges, machines aluminum &
    	Sheet and tubing, some sharp edges exist after machining. &
    	Deburr edges where possible. Contain sharp edges in tough material. During transportation, use protective gloves when handling if sharp edges are still present. \\\hline

    	Massive bulky structure &
    	The mass of the assembly poses risk of trapped and damaged fingers or feet being crushed. &
    	Order of assembly should be well thought out and practiced. At least two people are present during assembly and; there is a dedicated space for assembly. \\\hline

    	Parts dropping from gondola &
    	Parts are heavy enough to cause harm if they fall onto people. &
    	All parts sufficiently fastened. Testing conducted to ensure fastening is able to hold all parts in place in case of turbulence. Where possible, add assurance by adding additional fixations. \\\hline
