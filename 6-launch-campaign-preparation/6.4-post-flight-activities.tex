\subsection{Post Flight Activities}
As no component of the experiment was hazardous, no special precautions were needed for recovery. If possible, the whole experiment were to be collected as-is.

If it was not possible to collect the whole experiment due to external damage or otherwise, then the on-board data storage SD-card were to be collected. The experiment was designed with this as a consideration, and the data storage unit was removable in a non-invasive manner. Instructions was provided on securing that the gimbal was locked in the stowage position, and that no actuators were powered. Manual shutdown was possible, were the automated shutdown to have failed.

The data was then be taken off site for further analysis.
