\subsection{Post Flight Activities}
As no component of the experiment is hazardous, no special precautions are needed for recovery. If possible, the whole experiment should be collected as-is.

If it is not possible to collect the whole experiment due to external damage or otherwise, then the on-board data storage SD-card shall be collected. The experiment will be designed with this as a consideration, and the data storage unit will be removable in a non-invasive manner. Instructions will be provided on securing that the gimbal is locked in the stowage position, and that no actuators are powered. Manual shutdown will be possible, should the automated shutdown have failed.

The data will then be taken off site for further analysis.
