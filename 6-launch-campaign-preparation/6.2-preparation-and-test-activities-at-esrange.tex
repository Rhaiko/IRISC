\subsection{Preparation and Test Activities at Esrange}\label{prep_for_Esrange}
\hl{In order to ensure that the process of unpacking, assembling, mounting, and testing the experiment when arriving at Esrange is done properly a complete check list will be written. The complete procedure will be tested beforehand and the list will be checked twice. This list will include sequential checks of all systems for different steps of the setup. For instance, when first mounting everything on site a number of mechanical and electrical checks will be performed, followed by software checks, including camera connection, motor control, and ground station connection. When the experiment is mounted in the gondola all these checks will be performed once more. The last part of the check list will list any RBF tags or other late access activities.}


\st{When arriving at Esrange the ground station and E-link will be set up and tested. The control system will be checked, and a picture will be sent in order to ensure functionality of all components. The experiment will then be stowed and a protective cap will cover the optics.}
