\subsection{Preparation and Test Activities at Esrange}\label{prep_for_Esrange}
In order to ensure that the process of unpacking, assembling, mounting, and testing the experiment when arriving at Esrange was done properly a complete check list was written. The complete procedure was tested beforehand and the list was checked twice. This list included sequential checks of all systems for different steps of the setup. For instance, when first mounting everything on site a number of mechanical and electrical checks would be performed, followed by software checks, including camera connection, motor control, and ground station connection. When the experiment was mounted in the gondola all these checks were performed once more. The last part of the check list listed any RBF tags or other late access activities.
