\subsection{Input for the Campaign / Flight Requirements Plans}


\subsubsection{Dimensions and Mass}
\label{sec:dim-mass}

The data shown in Table \ref{tab:dim-mass-tab} below is based on the design presented in Section \ref{Mechanical_Design}. %The mass for the electronics is estimated to be 1.5 kg.

\subsubsection{Safety Risks}
Table \ref{tab:safrisk} contains the risks of all stages of the whole campaign and project.

\subsubsection{Electrical Interfaces}

%Please refer to Table \ref{tab:electrical-interface-table} for details on the electrical interfaces with the gondola.

\subsubsection{Launch Site Requirements}
Prior to launch, in the case that ice has appeared on the experiment prohibiting free motion for the controller, a small electric heater fan will be needed to remove the ice.

Post launch a laptop PC will be used to send and receive data to the experiment. For this a desk and chair will be needed, along with a power outlet and ethernet cable for E-link connection.


\subsubsection{Flight Requirements}
The flight requirements for the IRISC experiment are stated below.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Desired float altitude:} A height of >20\,km is adequate for this experiment. However, a higher altitude will improve the signal to noise ratio.
	\item \textbf{Desired float duration:} We need a floating time of at least 90 min in order to collect sufficient amount of data. A longer floating time would desirable.
	\item \textbf{Required launch time:} A partial night flight would be preferable because there is less interference with the sun and a wider range of view. However, the system will be designed to be able to function during the entire day.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Accommodation Requirements}

Assuming that the experiment is able to be mounted to an outer side of the gondola as shown in figure \ref{accomrec}, the objective end of the telescope \textit{must} be able to point outside of the gondola for the entirety of the float phase, preferably to an angle of 60 degrees above the horizontal. Additionally, it should be able to move such that it has a viewing angle of 45 degrees horizontally in either direction. The telescope requires a "slewing area" of approximately 650\,mm wide, 350\,mm deep and 350\,mm high within the gondola.
