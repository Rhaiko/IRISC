\subsection{Experiment Concept}

The experiment was comprised of a telescope with baffle, a CMOS sensor, and a gimbal stabilisation system, which worked together to obtain long-exposure images of astronomical targets. The control system was responsible for selecting and tracking the astronomical targets using the position and orientation of the BEXUS gondola. It also stabilised the telescope during exposure using an active feedback control. Sensors included a gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, and a compass/magnetometer, to ensure all vital information for finding and tracking targets was available to the control system. There was also a verification system with an additional camera that could indicate pointing errors if the images obtained by the NIR camera were not as expected. The thermal control system would ensure that an optimal operational temperature was maintained for the duration of the experiment.
