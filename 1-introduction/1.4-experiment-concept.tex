\subsection{Experiment Concept}

The experiment will be comprised of a telescope with baffle, a CMOS sensor, and a gimbal stabilisation system, which will work together to obtain long-exposure images of astronomical targets. The control system is responsible for selecting and tracking the astronomical targets using the position and orientation of the BEXUS gondola. It also stabilises the telescope during exposure using an active feedback control. Sensors include a gyroscope, accelerometer, GPS, and a compass/magnetometer, to ensure all vital information for finding and tracking targets is available to the control system. A small sanity camera will also be used for visual verification of the state of the system, in the event that images provided by the BEXUS telemetry are not as expected. The thermal control system will ensure that an optimal operational temperature is maintained for the duration of the experiment.
