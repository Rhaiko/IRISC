\subsection{Experiment Objectives}

The primary objectives of the experiment can be split into a main scientific objective, and a main technical objective: the primary scientific objective was to establish the SNR improvement (if any) from ground-based observations to stratospheric observations in the infrared. In order to achieve this scientific objective, the primary technical objective was to construct a gimbal system that is capable of stabilising the optics setup to arcsecond accuracy.\\

Pending success of these primary objectives, secondary scientific and technical objectives include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item (Scientific) Observations of globular and open star clusters for the purpose of population studies
    \item (Scientific) Observations and evaluation of galaxies and nebulae for fine structure detail and infrared characteristics
    \item (Scientific) Comparison of IRISC observations with observations done by other instruments in the same wavelength band
    \item (Technical) Construction of a thermal system suitable for maintaining and optimising operation of a near-infrared camera within the BEXUS environment
\end{enumerate}
