\subsection{Mission Statement}

Studying astronomical targets in the infrared from ground-based observatories is hampered by atmospheric distortion and extinction, limiting the amount and kind of infrared research that can be done. Therefore, having a telescope make observations from above the majority of interfering atmosphere will negate these effects, and improve the SNR and therefore scientific quality of the obtained images. Establishing a functional, low-cost system for performing infrared observations from a stratospheric balloon will help to push the boundaries of infrared astronomy.
