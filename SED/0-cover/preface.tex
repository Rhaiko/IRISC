The Rocket and Balloon Experiments for University Students (REXUS/BEXUS) programme is realized under a bilateral Agency Agreement between the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB). The Swedish share of the
payload has been made available to students from other European countries through a collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA).

EuroLaunch, a cooperation between the Esrange Space Center of SSC and the Mobile Rocket Base (MORABA) of DLR, is responsible for the campaign management and operations of the launch vehicles. Experts from DLR, SSC, ZARM, and ESA provide
technical support to the student teams throughout the project.

The Student Experiment Documentation (SED) is a continuously updating document regarding the BEXUS student experiment IRISC - InfraRed Imaging of astronomical targets with a Stabilized Camera and will undergo reviews during the preliminary design review, the critical design review, the integration progress review, and final experiment report.
