\textbf{ID} & \textbf{Risk (\& consequence if)} & \textbf{P} & \textbf{S} & \textbf{P * S} & \textbf{Action} \\ \hline


TC10 & Optics and/ or camera destroyed due to testing						& C & 2 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low 		& There is budget for a spare part, it is quite easy to get and test where it will likely fail (e.g. drop test) will not be done with this part.\\\hline

TC20 & Optics and/ or camera destroyed due to looking directly into the sun & B & 3 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low 		& A model will be made and sufficient testing will make sure that the probability gets very low.\\\hline

TC30 & Software failure														& B & 3 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low 		& A watchdog with power-on-reset will be added to the design.\\\hline

TC40 & Motors of the gimbal are uncontrollable								& B & 4 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low 		& It will be made sure that a single component failure will not result in this consequence.\\\hline

TC50 & Motors overloaded													& A & 3 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low 	& Sufficient testing and modeling will be done to decrease the probability.\\\hline

TC60 & PCB failure															& B & 3 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low 		& Sufficient testing will be done on each PCB to decrease the probability.\\\hline

TC70 & Single component failure gives unprecedented failure					& B & 4 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low			& A Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) study will be done so that single failure components with a high impact will be documented and migrated.\\\hline


MS10 & Target not found														& D & 2 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low			& The ground station will be able to correct this, or send the system to another target.\\\hline


MS20 & Damage to the system on landing										& D & 1 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low			& Optics will move inside a frame for protection.\\\hline

MS30 & Damage to the storage unit on landing									& C & 2 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low			& Data will be send over telemetry\\\hline

MS40 & Storage unit full during flight											& A & 3 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& Sufficient modeling will be done to decrease the probability.\\\hline

MS50 & BEXUS balloon power failure											& A & 4 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& -\\\hline

MS60 & BEXUS balloon telemetry failure										& B & 2 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& The system will be able to function autonomously.\\\hline


SF10 & Components falling off the gondola									& A & 4 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& All parts sufficiently fastened. Testing conducted to ensure fastening is able to hold all parts in place in case of turbulence. Where possible, add assurance by adding additional fixations.\\\hline


VE10 & Short circuiting														& B & 3 & \cellcolor[HTML]{FCFF2F}Low			& A fuse is in the power system added.\\\hline

VE20 & Collision of telescope with landing mechanism						& A & 4 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& The experiment will be inside a frame for protection.\\\hline


PE10 & Miscommunication in the team											& B & 2 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& The management team should be responsible for ensuring proper information is conveyed to all team members.\\\hline

PE20 & People are not available												& C & 1 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& An availability sheet is made so a planning can be made. This will be kept up to date during the entire project.\\\hline

PE30 & Management team unavailable to oversee project						& C & 1 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& There is always someone as a backup.\\\hline

PE40 & Sudden resignation of project members								& B & 2 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& Management team ensure morale remains high through a variety of techniques (group building activities).\\\hline


EN10 & Rays focused on someone due to damage to the telescope (camera)		& A & 4 & \cellcolor[HTML]{34FF34}Very Low	& Calibration of telescope set properly so that rays do not get misguided\\\hline
