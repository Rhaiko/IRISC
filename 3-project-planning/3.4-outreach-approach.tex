\subsection{Outreach Approach}
An important focus of the project is the topic of outreach. During the whole timeline, updates about the project will be shared with as many people as possible. The most effective way of reaching people is via social media. IRISC is represented on the following social media platforms:
\begin{itemize}

	\item twitter/IRISCBEXUS
\end{itemize}
Additionally to the social media platforms, the team's website with information about the project is available and updates are blogged there regularly.\newline\newline

\begin{itemize}
	\item articles at university blog of the Lule{\aa}} University of Technology
	\item articles in local newspaper
	\item visibility through posters, flyers, etc at university
